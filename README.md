# Navigation Server-Router


## Description
The navigation server-router aggregate and distribute navigation and other operational data aboard recreational vessels.
It is a focal point and server for all kind of data needed to control the course and operational condition of the boat.
The system is based on the building blocks described here below. 
The configuration and parameters of the system are described in a Yaml file.
All building blocks are optional, but if there is no Instrument or Publisher nothing will happen.

The system works with a single Python process and messages are exchanged internally. This can lead to a scalability problem but this was not observed so far.



### Servers
The servers are TCP servers allowing any navigation or control application to access the flow of data via TCP/IP.
There is a generic server: NMEAServer. This server is sending all messages coming from the associated instruments to the clients.
Client can also send messages to the server that are sent to the instrument input.
The default protocol is NMEA0183 based even if it carries NMEA2000 messages (Digital Yacht like sentence)

### Instruments
Instrument classes are connecting to instrumentation bus via direct interfaces or couplers. Direct communication via serial lines is also supported.
Currently, tested instruments:
- Shipmodul Miniplex3 Ethernet
- Digital Yacht iKonvert
- Yachting Digital Ethernet
- Direct serial link on NMEA0183
- Victron energy device with VEDirect serial line

Under preparation
- Direct CAN Access

| talker          | string (2)                           | None | Talker ID substitution for NMEA0183      |
| protocol | nmea0183, nmea2000 | nmea0183 | Messsage processing directive nmea0183 treat all messages as NMEA0183 sentence, nmea2000: translate in NMEA2000 when possible |
| direction       | read_only, write_only, bidirectional | bidirectional | Direction of excahnge with device |
| trace_messages  | boolean                              | False | Trace all messages after internal pre-processing |
| trace_raw | boolean | False | Trace all messages in device format |


### Publishers
Publishers concentrate messages from several instruments towards consumers. Publishers are implicitly created by Servers when a new client connection is created.
There are also specific Publishers for tracing and logging.
One particular Publisher is the Injector that allows sending the output of one instrument to the input of another one.


## Installation
The project is entirely written in Python 3 and has been tested with Python 3.7 - 3.9. It is intended to run on Linux based system
